## INFO PROJECT STATUS ##
Currently the bot is written for the Doom Sumo Workshop discord server (https://discord.gg/3VmmEmxy6W).
While it duable to implement a copy of this bot, note you have to tweak some things yourself. Especially regarding role permissions which are hardcoded.


## STILL TRYING? ##
Download the required pip packages and make sure to place a .env file in the project folder. The env file should specify;
DISCORD_API_TOKEN = "your-token"
GUILD = "your-guild-id"
